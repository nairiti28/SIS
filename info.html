   <b> ‘Young people should obey their elders without question’. What do you think?</b>
<br>
<p>The elders are always respected in any society. They’re the ones who have had the most experience in the world; they are the ones who pass down the customs and traditions. Younger people are subjected to obey them at all times. Should young people be compelled to do so without having a say in it?</P>

<p>Firstly, we, as human beings primarily have a thirst for freedom. But saying youngsters should obey their elders at all times without a question, without having a say completely disregards our right. Young people should have a chance to speak up, raise their voices and question the activities they are instructed to do. Why should anyone not be allowed to freely question others? Youngsters can make their own choices; they can freely do any activity they want. These free souls should not be under the binds of what the elders say.</P>

<p>Likewise, even if elders have lived longer and have more experience than the youngsters, how can we trust their decisions and beliefs? With a highly tech-savvy generation of the youngsters, they know the better decision; not the elders. Personally, my grandmother advises me not to take the path through which a black cat walked. This is a baseless and illogical superstition. There is no harm in taking the path. Why should I be subjected to not take the path just because my grandmother told me not to? Her decision was groundless and inaccurate. We are humans who make mistakes: everything the elders say is not always right.</P>

<p>Similarly, age does not equal to wisdom. We cannot truly say that the elders are wiser than the youth. Truthfully, the saying “Elders know what is best” is incorrect. The elders may be associated in wrongful acts, if the youngsters are to obey every single instruction, they may get into trouble. There is no guarantee of the elders knowing what is best for the youngsters. Youngsters should be in control of their own life and if they make mistakes: they should learn from it themselves. When the elders pass away, the one who obeyed elders their whole life would struggle to stand on their feet.</P>

<p>On the other hand, even though there are many reasons on why youngsters should not obey elders without any question, there are reasons why they should.<br>

<P>The elders may have made mistakes when they were young, they must have learned from it. The elders may regret the decision and can guide the younger ones to a brighter future. Youngsters can obey them build a good life.</P>

<p>Many people say how obeying their elders helped them a lot. This may be wrong in some situations but obedience helped them achieve a higher level of success. Though I believe that we should be subjected to obey everything, questioning their instructions is vital. Therefore, youngsters should have a chance to question what they have been instructed to do before obeying the elders.</P>

    <b>Critical Review of the poem “The Rivals”</b><br>
<p>James Stephens, an Irish novelist and poet wrote the poem “The Rivals”. His writing is said to be comical and lyrical. The poem depicts a morning scene where a bird sings melodiously about the dew and wind. The speaker also sings like the bird and doesn’t listen to the bird’s singing as he believes that the bird is worthless because it didn’t sing for him. Likewise, the person intends to compete with the bird since he sings as beautifully as the bird. </p>
<p>The poem has a frustrating and passionate tone as the speaker sings as beautifully as the bird but remains unnoticed. However, the amusing mood created by the speaker’s unnecessary competition with bird makes the poem comical. The unaware bird sings mellifluously but the speaker with his rivalry tries his best to overshadow the bird. The poem depicts the emotion of rivalry which causes unnecessary competition between people.  In a world where everything is distinguished into good or bad, people focus on their benefit and deem others from it. The person in the poem starts a rivalry with the bird because it didn’t sing for him, lessening his benefit. He sings just as beautifully as the bird but with an ugly emotion, rivalry. The poet uses first and third narrative voices which show the person’s feelings and the unawareness of the bird. He uses personification giving the bird a human sensation which makes him the rival of the speaker. The poet also uses simile to represent the thought of the speaker as he sings just as prettily as the bird. The use of assonance highlights the rhymes used in the poem. He also uses repetition that highlights the major points of the poem.</p>
<p>The title of the poem, “The Rivals” signifies the rivalry initiated by the speaker with the bird, given his ability to just as beautifully. The representation of rivalry in the poem has been written assiduously. The poem is notably great.</p>

   <b> Life’s journey</b><br>
“If we could only be filled with pleasure<br>
If we never felt any pain<br>
Life could never become better<br>
It would be monotonous and plain<br>
As we paint on our canvas<br>
We’ll start achieving<br>
Happiness comes with sadness<br>
Life’s journey is fascinating<br>
Pain gives us drive<br>
For pleasure as we rise<br>
It makes us feel alive<br>
To be dexterous and wise<br>
Life’s journey requires pain<br>
Life’s journey requires pleasure”<br>
The aged father explained<br>
To his son, his treasure<br>
